todo list to keep me on task:
#1: refactor the code from SDL example to work with non built in main function
replacements. Don't need to provide a visualization, just log it in console.
    - specifically log the two sticks, and can ignore everything else for now

#2: draw two sprites of whatever; could be hands, just anything

#3: move left/right sprite according to sticks

#4: implement gravity on a new Ball struct
