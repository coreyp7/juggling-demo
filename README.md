This was an idea I had for awhile that I thought would be neat: a juggling game with a gampad (written specifically for an xbox controller).

Left/Right stick control position of Left/Right hand respectively.
Left/Right trigger allows open/close of Left/Right hand respectively.
There's only 3 balls. Pressing the A button resets the positions of the balls to a place that's easy to start from.

Will upload footage of this and put the link to it here. Maybe a gif too. Just give me a bit.
