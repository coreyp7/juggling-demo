Footage of this is found on my youtube (also can find it on my website).

This was an idea I had for awhile that I thought would be neat: a juggling game with a gampad (written specifically for an xbox controller).

Left/Right stick control position of Left/Right hand respectively.
Left/Right trigger allows open/close of Left/Right hand respectively.
There's only 3 balls. Pressing the A button resets the positions of the balls to a place that's easy to start from.


By the way, it was a couple day affair, so everything is literally in one file and probably quite unorganized and gross. Be warned. Stay away.
